# Welcome! 

Thanks for using Krypto, we are super duper excited to share this awesome project with you. We know for some using a new application can be rough 
so we made a comprehensive guide, (thingy you are reading now), to kick it in the butt. 

## Getting Started

Assuming you have installed Krypto already, lets start off by opening the application. By default, the Krypto Dashboard does not launch first, the browser does (Boot's Request which I don't blame him), anyways, you can access the dashboard to explore Krypto, and find some awesome features. 

Our main other features are: **Krypto EasyCapture**, a screencapture utility with Imgur Uploading capabilities, **Krypto EasyNotes**, a word processor/notepad utility that can help you get that report done that was due 3 days ago. Easynotes is pretty basic, but that is why we love it. AutoSaving, Wordcounting, and much more. **Krypto Calculator** Of course we can help you with those pesky calculations, its not a science calculator (yet) and unfortunately we can't help you with your algebra homework either, but its good for basic operations. And it has a feature most don't, Saving! You can save your math for later, in case you need it for something! 

Other features, are built into the browser, and include SSL (In simple terms we will tell you if its safe) Information, Internet Diagnostics (why is your internet slow you did pay your bill right?). As well as a dynamic update center, tons of customizing, and tons of love. 

# Shortcuts, and helpful stuff

### Shortcuts

We tried to keep the shortcuts on the same concept as other browsers, some however were not possible so we made you a chart!

### History, and Cookies/Website Data

Webbrowsing History is stored safely out of reach from any person accessing your computer, even you! You can delete any item individually or clear out the whole shabang. Most of those options are built into a right click menu (context menu) 

We don't have full support for other types of data just yet, but its coming soon, *very soon*, you can for your convience clear cookies but can't view just yet (that is what is coming soon). 

### Safe-Browsing/Private Browsing

Built right into the Browser is our preciously designed, and developed Private browsing mode. We have several options for private mode, some help you live on the edge, and others are just helpful. 

+ Customize your search engine, by default we have a "Safe mode" toggle, where we force Duck Duck Go while in private. You can always disable this

+ View history in Private mode, a feature many others lack, we felt this was a missing feature, we know the idea of private browsing, but we also know people need features. You can disable this too, its enabled by default, its a signature feature, we all love. It is always deleted at the end of your session, at either browser window close or going back to regular mode. 

+ Seamless transformation, go between the two browsing modes seamlessly, note that you will want to reload your current page to go into the safe mode (we don't do it automatically in case its somethign you didn't save)
