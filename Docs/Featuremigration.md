# Krypto is the new BeffsBrowser

Unfortunately, until recently it was hard for me to update and upload all source code retaining to the BeffsBrowser project. So not all features are 
outlined, the purpose of this doc, is to show the progress of features migrating from BeffsBrowser Legacy, to BeffsBrowser Krypto, Legacy was the original 
build, that I started as a teenager, and highschooler. Krypto is my advanced project, that I am tag teaming with a long time friend. [@bootsie123](https://github.com/bootsie123)
