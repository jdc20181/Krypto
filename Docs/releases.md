# Krypto Releases Information

Releases are a formatted versioning system to keep track of application progress throughout the life of Kryto. 

Each release is ran through a 3 layered pipeline: Developers Branch, Canary (Beta Branch), and Stable. 

The Developers Branch is for development only and is not released on Github, or as a release. These are usually local only. 

The Canary Branch is for those who wish to see our newest additions. These change a lot and vary from Weekly to daily. This is also not on Github, although the release can be downloaded via our website. 

The Stable Branch is the latest and is intended for most users, and follow the [release schedule](https://github.com/jdc20181/Krypto/blob/master/Releases/readme.md#release-schedule)
