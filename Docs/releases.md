# Krypto Releases

**Overview** 


Krypto is divided out into 3 release types: Developer, Canary, and Stable Releases. 

The Developer Branch is the private in-house development environment from which we release our canary version, which is the Beta testing version, where we use our 3-stage Building Flow to bring you a stable release. 

Our Build Flow is as follows: Mechanical, Staging, Release Candidate. 


Once a build qualifies for a release candidate, we polish up the remaining items they may need attention and begin final preparations for a stable release.  

Stable Releases occur generally, once every 4-6 weeks or longer depending on the build-flow stage. 

**Downloading, and using different release versions** 

We have two release options available for download: Stable, and Canary

Stable is our public finalized version from our building flow. This is suitable for most general users. Those who want a more dependable product or rely on such. 


Canary is our public developmental release, designed to test new features, potential bug fixes, and to test mechanical upgrades that may impact a large number of users. This build is intended to be used by those who like to test new things, and are generally technically-educated (you know somewhat at least what you are doing)
