# Updates Guide

Welcome to Krypto's Documentation about updates! 


**Auto Updates** 

Krypto comes with built in auto-upgrade technology, this works by checking updates automatically in the background. The default is to check every 72 hours (3 days), and only check every 7, so for example, if today was Monday it would check again Wednesday, and once more Saturday, then it would wait 7 days before checking again, in the same 3 day interval. 

Updates are automatic you will be notified when an update is occuring so you can avoid data charges, or unexpected difficulties. Updates will not require a lot of data, however it is reccomended to use a High speed DSL connection to update. 

**Manual Updates Dashboard** 

In the event of Krypto not updating correctly, giving you an error, or for any other reason, you can manually check and install updates. The dashboard is also equipt with settings to customize when to check and install updates, and assisting you with knowing when there is an update.
