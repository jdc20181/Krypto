# Security Policy



In an effort to maintain a high level of application security and avoid security vulnerabilities, we have set in place an Archiving policy that will depreciate older versions. For direct details about this policy see our [Archive Policy](https://github.com/jdc20181/Krypto/tree/master/Releases#archiving-policy). In addition, we have auto-updates so when a new update is available it is automatically downloaded, and installed. 




**Security Vulnerabilities & Public Information**

The Krypto Dev Team takes security seriously, you should too! Don’t ever post security threats on Github, or in public channels, do the right thing and privately contact us on Discord. You should only contact one of the founder’s, don’t contact contributors or developers. 

If we have a security alert either by Github, or a community member, we will post 24-hours of investigating or when it is patched whichever comes first, while we strive to keep you informed, due to the nature of our project we keep security flaws under the radar to best protect our users.
