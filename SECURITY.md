# Security Policy



In an effort to maintain a high level of application security and avoid security vulnerabilities, we have set in place an Archiving policy that will depreciate older versions. For direct details about this policy see our [Archive Policy](https://github.com/jdc20181/Krypto/tree/master/Releases#archiving-policy)


The Krypto Dev Team takes security seriously, you should too! Don’t ever post security threats on Github, or in public channels, do the right thing and privately contact us on Discord. You should only contact one of the founder’s, don’t contact a developer.
